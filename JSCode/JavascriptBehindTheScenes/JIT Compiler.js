// JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation is a technique used by JavaScript engines to improve the performance of executing JavaScript code. It works by dynamically translating JavaScript code into machine code at runtime, allowing the engine to execute the code more efficiently. The JIT compilation process involves the following steps:

// 1. **Parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation:**
//    The JavaScript engine first parses the JavaScript code to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This tree represents the syntactic structure of the code.

// 2. **Bytecode Generation:**
//    After parsing, the engine generates an intermediate representation known as bytecode, which is a low-level, platform-independent set of instructions.

// 3. **Profiling and Optimization:**
//    As the code executes, the JIT compiler collects data about the code's performance. It identifies hot paths or frequently executed parts of the code and optimizes them for better performance. This includes inlining functions, eliminating redundant checks, and optimizing loops.

// 4. **Compilation to Machine Code:**
//    The JIT compiler then translates the optimized bytecode into machine code, which can be directly executed by the underlying hardware. This machine code is cached for future use to avoid recompilation overhead.

// 5. **Execution of Machine Code:**
//    The optimized machine code is executed, resulting in faster and more efficient execution of the JavaScript code.

// Here is a simplified example of how JIT compilation works:

// ```javascript
// // JavaScript code
// function add(a, b) {
//   return a + b;
// }

// let sum = 0;
// for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
//   sum += add(i, i + 1);
// }
// console.log(sum);
// ```

// In this example, the JIT compiler would identify the `add` function as a hot function since it's being called repeatedly in the loop. It might then decide to inline the function and optimize the loop to improve performance. The optimized machine code would be generated and executed for faster computation.

// JIT compilation significantly enhances the execution speed of JavaScript code, especially in cases where repetitive tasks or computations are involved. Modern JavaScript engines, such as V8 in Google Chrome and SpiderMonkey in Firefox, utilize JIT compilation to provide faster and more efficient execution of JavaScript code.
