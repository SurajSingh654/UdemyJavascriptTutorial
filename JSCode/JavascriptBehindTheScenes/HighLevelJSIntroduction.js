// What is JavaScript?
// JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
// High-level: It is a language that is close to human language.
// Object-oriented: It is a language that is based on objects.
// Multi-paradigm: It is a language that supports different programming paradigms.
// Programming paradigms: It is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles.
// Examples of programming paradigms: procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, etc.
// Procedural programming: It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of the procedure call.
// Procedure: It is a set of instructions that performs a specific task.
// Object-oriented programming: It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
// Object: It is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions â€” which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).
// Functional programming: It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of functions.
// Function: It is a set of statements that performs a specific task or calculates a value.
// Examples of high-level programming languages: JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, etc.
// Examples of low-level programming languages: Assembly, C, C++, etc.

// High-Level vs Low-Level
// High-level: It is a language that is close to human language.Developer doesn't need to worry , everything happens automatically.
// Low-level: It is a language that is close to machine language.Developer needs to worry about memory management, etc.Developer has to manage resources manually.

// Garbage-collected: Cleans the memory automatically
// Paradigm: An approach and mindset of structuring code , which will direct your coding style and technique.
// First-class function: Simply treated as variable
// Event loop: By using an event loop, takes long running tasks , executes them in the 'background' and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished!
